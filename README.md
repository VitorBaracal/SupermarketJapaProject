This is a simple supermarket management system developed in Java. It allows registering new products, listing the registered products, buying products, viewing the shopping cart, and finalizing the purchase.

When the system starts, the user is presented with a menu with options to register products, list products, buy products, view the cart, or exit the system. To register a product, just provide the name and price. When making a purchase, the user selects the product by its code and enters the quantity. The shopping cart displays the selected items and allows finalizing the purchase, showing the total amount.
